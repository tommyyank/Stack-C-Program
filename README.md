# Stack-C-Program

<h2>Description</h2>

- <b>This is a project where I had to work with the memory stack. In the file "stack.c" I wrote a function that will obtain and print information about the stack. The function traverses through the memory, starting at the current stack pointer and prints information about each byte as it traverses. I have uploaded the entire project but note the only code that I wrote myself are in "stack.c" and the makefile. The rest was provided by my professor in order to complete the project. </b>
